# headj FAQ

## Q: Why does this have a ridiculous name?

The name is supposed to suggest the `head` command from unix/linux except for JSON. I tried a number of variations,
but they were all being used by something else. `headj` was not being used, was simple to remember & to type, &
was reasonably descriptive. I thought of "hedge" as an obviously more clever name, but someone is using that. So,
`headj` it is.
